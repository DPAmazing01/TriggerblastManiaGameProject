# Triggerblast Mania Game

- Triggerblast Mania is a game made in Unity using the VR core, and itâ€™s a simple target shooter game (Worked on from March-April 2025)
- Game includes 5 levels, where each level features 3 rooms for the player to complete
- Each level is set to a different difficulty (Starting from Easy and going to Extreme), and the difficulties incorporate different visual effects
   - Easy is a standard level with no effects
   - Medium uses a particle system effect
   - Hard uses a fog effect
   - Master uses a darker lighting effect
   - Extreme combines all 3 effects (Particle system, fog, darker lighting)
- Main gameplay involves looking around each room by rotating your head and destroying all the targets in each room by grabbing and using the blaster that spawns in each room, with a level being completed when the player gets through all 3 rooms
- Game also includes a built-in dev time system where each level has a set dev time, and beating the dev time for all 5 levels unlocks a secret ending
